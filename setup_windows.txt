=============================================

Installing OpenCV from prebuilt binaries
Below Python packages are to be downloaded and installed to their default locations.

1.1. Python-2.7.x.

1.2. Numpy.

1.3. Matplotlib (Matplotlib is optional, but recommended since we use it a lot in our tutorials).

Install all packages into their default locations. Python will be installed to C:/Python27/.

After installation, open Python IDLE. Enter import numpy and make sure Numpy is working fine.

Download latest OpenCV release from sourceforge site (https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/) and double-click to extract it.

Goto opencv/build/python/2.7 folder.

Copy cv2.pyd to C:/Python27/lib/site-packages.

Open Python IDLE and type following codes in Python terminal.

>>> import cv2
>>> print cv2.__version__

If the results are printed out without any errors, congratulations !!! You have installed OpenCV-Python successfully.
